# Google Maps Infobox - Windowed

This repository and npm module only encapsulates the original script into a window variable so it can be used directly with TS loaded via 'shim', and doesn't modify it's source.

## How to use

### npm
```
npm install google-maps-infobox-window
```


### bower
```
bower install google-maps-infobox-windowed
```
